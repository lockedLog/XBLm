# XBLm

XBLm is a conceptual but functional tool that automates messaging on xbox live. Messages target specific games and their audience, and is one of the customizable features. Their are five options to choose from for this tool. 

The message will send a post from your feed. The link to said post will need to be inputted in the config file prior to running. Other options to configure include amount of time to run for, whether to delete the post when the tool has finished running, and whether to automatically remove comments on the post.

Stats like messages sent, rate limit, account bans/locks, and more are updated and displayed in real time.

I do not condone the use of this tool to send nefarious messages, spam, or anything else against xbox TOS. This is merely a POC of sorts. I will not be providing a tool or explaining how to grab the necessary authentication tokens.
