# XBLm

XBLm is a tool that automates messaging on xbox live. Messages target specific games via looking for group scraping (both requests to join and post owners). This version is set for an instance of messaging fortnite players only.

The message will send a post from your feed. The tool will create this post itself and grab the url necessary to send it. Message can be added in source on this version. (no config)

Stats like messages sent, rate limit, account bans/locks, comments and likes on post, and more are updated and displayed in real time.

I do not condone the use of this tool to send nefarious messages, spam, or anything else against xbox TOS. Version has been slightly updated.

*This is an old version, and the Go counterpart files that generate the accounts necessary in the process will NOT ever be uploaded as my contributions to it amounted to less than 15%. This is a retired tool that is now only a POC.
Redundant headers and webhook requests, manual source configs, and unique checking xuid logic fixed in newest private version.
