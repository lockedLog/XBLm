# XBLm

XBLm is a tool that automates messaging on xbox live. Messages target specific games via looking for group scraping (both requests to join and post owners)

The message will send a post from your feed. The tool will create this post itself and grab the url necessary to send it. 

Stats like messages sent, rate limit, account bans/locks, comments and likes on post, and more are updated and displayed in real time.

I do not condone the use of this tool to send nefarious messages, spam, or anything else against xbox TOS. I will not be providing a tool or explaining how to grab the necessary authentication tokens. Version has been slightly updated.
